DeveloperVerse is a social networking website where users can share projects, photographs, and post links to their personal github pages. DeveloperVerse is also an online social gathering point, with a multitude of regular events ranging from casual meetups, to technical expos, occurring every week. We leverage the centralizing power of the internet to bring people closer together, to foster career building, personal growth, civic-mindedness, healthy debate, and friendships that can reach beyond the digital world.
